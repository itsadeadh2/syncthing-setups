# Itsadead's Syncthing Setups

[![Deploy to Amazon ECS](https://github.com/itsadeadh2/syncthing-setups/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/itsadeadh2/syncthing-setups/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Collection of [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) setups that I use to sync my save states between my retro devices.

### Disclaimers
- **Be sure you understand how syncthing works before using it with your devices, if you mess up you can lose data!**
- I do not **maintain** or **own** any of the actual projects in here. This is just a repo with some instructions and convenience scripts that I created to make the syncthing setup easier.
